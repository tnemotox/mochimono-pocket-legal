App Review Notes

1. Overview
Mochimono Pocket is a checklist app designed for parents in Japan to manage their children's belongings for various occasions (school trips, pool days, daily commute, hospital visits, park outings, overnight trips, and sports days). The app supports family sharing with real-time sync so all family members can collaborate on checklists.

2. Backend & Cloud Sync
This app uses Firebase (Firestore) for cloud synchronization and data storage. An internet connection is required for account features and real-time family sharing. Data is stored in Firebase Firestore under the authenticated user's account.

3. Authentication
This app requires user authentication via Apple Sign-In or Google Sign-In. No demo account is provided — reviewers can sign in directly using their Apple ID or Google account. Authentication is required to access family sharing and cloud sync features.

4. No In-App Purchases or Advertisements
